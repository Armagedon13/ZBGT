# ZBGT

Addon mod for [GregTech CEu](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech)

## Currently Has:

Creative Energy Hatch
- Configurable like the creative emitter, but as a multiblock part.
- You need to make the multiblock reform when you change it's setting because right now because GregTech doesn't have a way for an energy container to notify the multiblock controller that it's voltage/amperage has changed.

Creative Reservoir Hatch
- Same as the normal reservoir hatch but can be changed to provide other fluids.

Dual Cover
- Combines the conveyor and pump into one cover!
- Currently has no texture because I'm not an artist <:(

## Planned:

Precise Dual Cover
- Will combine the Robot Arm and Fluid Regulator.
