# ZBGT

Currently only adds a creative energy hatch which is configurable like the creative emitter (but is a multiblock part).
- You need to make the multiblock reform when you change it's setting because right now, GregTech doesn't have a way for an energy container to notify the multiblock controller that it has changed.
