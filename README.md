# ZBGT

Addon mod for [GregTech CEu](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech)

Creative energy hatch
- Configurable like the creative emitter, but as a multiblock part.
- You need to make the multiblock reform when you change it's setting because right now, GregTech doesn't have a way for an energy container to notify the multiblock controller that it has changed.

Creative reservoir hatch
- Same as the normal reservoir hatch but can be changed to provide other fluids.
- Doesn't work with the JEI drag thingy :(.
- Doesn't seem to notify the multiblock when the fluid is changed. (Not sure how to fix rn)
